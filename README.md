### Focused Mode Plugin for IntelliJ

Rescued and improved version of the [Focused Plugin](http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7206?pr=idea)
by @asheb. This version adds toggling and also uses the right margin (Editor -> Code Style) to calculate
the padding.

Since this is mostly for personal use and I'm lazy I don't plan to publish this to the IntelliJ
Plugin repo.
